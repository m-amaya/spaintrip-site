## Highlights

### [Caves of Drach](http://www.cuevasdeldrach.com/en/)

The Cuevas del Drach were already known during the Middle Ages and were explored in 1880 by M. F. Will and in 1896 by E.A. Martel, who discovered the cave containing the lake that bears his name.
Between 1922 and 1935 the cave was conditioned to be visited by opening a new entrance, building paths, stairs, etc. and, above all, by installing electric lighting designed by the engineer, Mr. Buigas.
